#Installing cellPAINT 2D Project files:

1) Install “Unity Hub” from the official Unity website: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

2) From Unity hub select “LTS 2020.3.”

3) Select your desired platform. E.G. Windows, Linux, Mac. Click “Done” and the Unity engine should start to automatically download.

4) For a license version, the free Unity Personal edition should be enough to get started fiddling with the code :).

5) Using our public github repository either clone or download the cellPAINT2D project files to a convenient directory.

6) Back in “Unity Hub” navigate to the projects tab and in the “cellPAINT2D” project select “LTS 2020.3” as the current version.
